it's important to distinguish between Git and GitHub. Git is a version control system (VCS) primarily used for SCM. It has a robust feature set used for initializing and tracking code repositories. It is a piece of software installed locally on your computer.
On the other hand, GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform used for storing and accessing Git repositories, while also exposing some of the features found in Git within its browser-based interface.
Git and GitHub are mainly used for source code management. Although technically Git and GitHub could be used to track anything that involves textual diffs over the course of time, it's predominantly used for tracking code repositories and is often described as an SCM tool.
